##What does TechEmpower Have to do with the Framework Benchmarks?

In a [March 2013 blog entry](https://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/03/28/frameworks-round-1/), TechEmpower published the results of comparing the performance of several web application frameworks executing simple but representative tasks: serializing JSON objects and querying databases. The community reaction was terrific. TechEmpower received dozens of comments, suggestions, questions, criticisms, and most importantly, GitHub pull requests at the [repository TechEmpower set up for this project](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/). Since then, community input has been tremendous and the benchmarks now have regular updates called "rounds" where test implementations are regularly updated, and coverage is expanded.
